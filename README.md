My name is Kamila Trinkenschuh, I'm a high school student and interested in computer science, specifically I'm enthusiastic about Python, C# (Unity) and C++ programming. I've got experience in programming and customizing Large Language Models with the Huggingface Hub and the Tokenizer library in Python as well as machine learning in general. I also deal with the Linux operating system, especially Kali linux. My plans for the future are to learn more about the interface between machine learning and CNC/ABB programming.
